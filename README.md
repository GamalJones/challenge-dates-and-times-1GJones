# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Dates and Times

Follow the instructions provided on `kenzie.instructure` for this challenge. The `script.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection** (and the **Project Plan** if you complete the Advanced Level), but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Running the Unit Tests (Basic Level)

_(Instructions for how to install the unit testing framework and run the unit tests.)_

## Project Plan (Intermediate Level)

_(Put your project plan here. It could be pseudocode, an outline-style development plan, etc. But whatever form you choose, it should be detailed enough that another developer could feasibly use it to implement your solution.)_

## Reflection

### Basic Level

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

_(Put your reflection answer here.)_
Advantages	Disadvantages
Helps in finding bugs early. The sooner a bug is found, the easier and cheaper it is to fix.	This testing can increase the initial development time. The developer must take the time to write and debug the test cases and write the code itself.
Helps make the team more efficient in the long run. By this testing, as they code, developers can find and fix bugs more quickly.	This testing can lead to an unnecessary proliferation of test cases. This can lead to increased maintenance time, as the developer must then update and maintain these test cases.
It makes debugging more manageable, too, since you can pinpoint a bugâ€™s exact location more quickly.	This testing can induce false confidence in the quality of the code. A codebase with many unit tests may give the illusion of being well-tested and free of bugs. However, this is only sometimes the case, as unit tests only test a small portion of the codebase.
Unit tests can be automated. You can run tests automatically when the code is updated, saving time and human resources.	It can be quite challenging to test the GUI code.
This testing decreases the total testing cost. By catching bugs early and automating tests, you can save your company time and money in the long run.	This testing can not help catch all the bugs in the application.
### Intermediate Level

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?
